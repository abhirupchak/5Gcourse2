**SUPI**

After startup of UE, it needs to register with its SUPI ID to AMF, SUCI encryption in applied in this case .
So after power on of UE it registers with SUCI ID.
IMSI catcher was required in 3G and 4G for UEs to register themselves after power up.
This is improved by SUCI

After mobile has registered with AMF, AMF provides a TMSI(Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity) to the UE.

The communications between UE and Core Network will be done through this TMSI now, not SUCI.
A given TMSI is unique within AMF region.
For example, if a AMF region has many GNBs then all of them will use the same TMSI
