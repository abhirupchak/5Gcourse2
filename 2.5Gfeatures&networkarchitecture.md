**Beamforming & Massive MIMO**

Massive MIMO and beamforming terms are used interchangeably.

MIMO technique suitable for wireless channels with lot of signal scattering.

8x8 mimo means 8 transmit antennas and 8 reciever antennas on UE.

A device can have both MIMO and beamforming service simultaneously.

In above picture we can see that many antenna elements are used for single UE,
in beamforming a narrow beam can be sent out to UEs.

**How 3D Beamforming Works**

By changin Amplitude and Phase of RF signal in transmitter we can send the beam into any direction in the 3D plane

**Change in Antenna Upon Change in Frequency**

For 3GHz signal we have large patch which can capture and transmit larger amounts of data from and to UE, Now for 30 GHz(or for mmwave-6Ghz+ concept is same) signal we have much smaller size patch.

To solve this problem we combine large number of these 30 ghz patches into large block

## Next Gen Node B

**GnodeB Functions**

Signal from UE is decrypted at gnodeb, data from gnode to UE also needs to compressed so that it occupies less bandwidth in the air interface.

Access Stratum signaling is when UE needs to access GnodeB

Non-Access Stratum signaling happens when UE needs to contact core network.

GnodeB also manages what resources(power,bandwidth) are to be allocated to a signal(radio resource management).

Communications with core network and nearby cells also needs to be done by gnodeb
