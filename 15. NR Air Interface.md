**GNB Channel Radio Bandwidth**

Out of entire channel bandwidth some is reserved for guard bandwidth and out of the remaining bandwidth only some part is used at a time(Active resource blocks).
Out of the transmission bandwidth only some part is used at a time depending on amount of traffic.

For higher bandwidth we cannot use 15KHz SCS.
And for 60Khz SCS smaller bandwidth cannot be used.

**NR-Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number**

This is a number used to identify a channel using its ref. freq.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab574bfa-4b1d-47dc-af19-e037fecf61da)

In the below image the ref. freq. of a channel changes slightly even though bandwidth is same, it will have diff. number.

**Global & Channel Raster**

Global raster is the min. difference between two ref. freqs.

Channel raster is the min.diff b/w center  freq.  of a channel.

**Bandwidth Part in 5G**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1acfbec-393a-4be2-b80a-374323492ad5)

Different numerology means that each BWP can use different SCS.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7836202-a1bc-46f3-9d29-f106b38b5150)

Only one BWP can be active at a time, hence overlap doesn't affect anything.

**Resource Grid on 5G Air Interface**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c29616f-0eba-4284-8253-45ed312e5460)

This time frequency arrangement as shown above is called resource grid.

These time frequency resources are arranged b/w UE and GNB for signalling or data transmission.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3521dcb9-b653-4e3d-aafd-55e3e7292472)

In below picture, there are 3 resource grids being shown, 3 ports which have 4 slots/subframe and only white part is being used currently.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02e8f7c3-459b-4a5d-992c-1dafe4144b4f)

Similarly,

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0f91300-21cb-4685-bc3f-d3e9dcf3af6a)

There are 9 downlink resource grids in this example. Number of uplink resource grids also depends on the same criteria.

## 5G NR Model for Air Intefaces

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e055af41-9746-4f84-af47-0ef1793ac474)

There are 3 channels in the air interface, physical, logical and transport. These have been compared to the layers of OSI model of networking.

Physical channel here is b/w UE and GNB.

Transport channel is b/w PHY layer and MAC.

Logical channel is b/w MAC and RLC layer.

A UE is said to be in RRC connected mode if it is actively transmitting and recieving data through these channels.

**1. Logical Channels**

Black arrows are for downlink and red are for uplink.
Logical channels are defined by what type of data it is channeling.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5445aa35-2484-4897-b53f-4f54c16dbd4e)

Logical Channels have been distributed into 3 broad types:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/742065e0-6ef2-4abc-b647-4a9baafd610d)

Dedicated channels are used when UE is in connected mode.
Common channels are used to intiate communication with GNB or by GNB to initiate comm. with UE.
Broadcast channels are used to communicate system information to the UEs in GNB cell.

**2. Transport Channels**

Transport Channels are defined by how data is being transferred or multiplexed.

All the channels with the { in front are transport channels.
We can see that logical channels are all mapping to and from these transport channels.

And on the Downlink Shared Channel(DL-SCH) many logical channels are being multiplexed.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/089d3e1d-e31e-4f40-a157-7b6e449d67d7)

**3. Physical Channels**

Till transport channel, data is being carried in form of bits. Now, over air interface we need to transform that into physical electromagnetic signals.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75505c5d-5543-489a-9225-29afe392a14e)

The channels starting with P are physical channels.

Here, the bits are changed into transmittable form by channel coding and modulation.

**Physical Signals**

In the above diagram, in yellow colour there are physical signals.

- Firstly we observe that almost every physical channel has a DM-RS(demodulation reference signal).
This signal helps the UE demodulate the signal from GNB by synchronizing its phase and frequency with the signal.  

This is why every phy channel that transmits some info has a DM-RS.

- Sounding Reference Signal (SRS)
   RB- resource block
  
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6108523c-0b04-4d3f-af0b-7b56868e91d3)

For example, if conditions are good 256 QAM(8bits/sec) can be used.

UE transmits this SRS on the uplink to GNB so that conditions of channel can be determined.

- CSI-RS is transmitted on downlink

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/029fe4d0-6936-4422-8842-c429c8bda95c)

- PT-RS(Phase Tracking ref signal)

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fab62f43-14f2-49e6-9ebe-f73f633fac11)

  Min. phase transmission error= min. bit loss

## Procedures of 5G Channels

**1. Cell Acquisition Procedure**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc6cc30c-b70d-4131-85d3-2c2a3ed6f0ef)

In the above picture, we can see the channels being used for this procedure.
The DM-RS, PSS & SSS(primary & secondary synchronization sequence) in the PBCH are together called the SSB.

This SSB is only transmitted on some specific frequency which is called the global synchronisation channel numbers,  so when a UE is powered on, it tunes to this frequency and finds the SSB on that frequency.

**Cell Acquisition-Beam Sweeping**

In a cell you have some beams that are transmitting in different directions.
Now the number of beams by a cell depends on the frequency, so for higher frequency there are more beams and thus more SSB bursts.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cd2d4c4-b3f8-42e2-859e-f2859f961bb1)

**Cell Acquisition - SSB block**

Now how is the SSB block mapped on the resource grid?  

Along frequency axis, SSB block spans 20 RBs and on time axis 4 OFDM symbols.

The PSS and SSS both span 127 subcarriers along the frequency axis.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d904709-47c5-4e40-bac4-4cf8f99f2696)

The UE measures the most powerful beam from UE using the DM-RS and chooses that.

The SSB block is modulated using QPSK.

**Cell Acquisition - Physical Cell ID**

Next, UE determines the physical cell ID of the cell.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7139d300-c86d-4083-8248-12c534053bcb)

PSS has 3 possible sequences from 0-2 and SSS has 336 from 0-335. Then cell id is calculated using above formula.
Cell ID can lie b/w 0-1007.

**Cell Acquisition- Minimum System Information**

Next, UE determines minimum system info.
This is the min. amount of data reqd to access a cell.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f159436f-f41c-4bc2-814b-bf3bf22e10ea)

The path of SIB is shown in the diagram.

The PDCCH plays a supporting role to the PDSCH.

**Cell Acquisition - Master Information Block**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c95cf03-7c11-4e70-84e4-3e6499910d10)

The PDCCH is transmitted at a portion of resource grid called as CORESET 0

**Cell Acquistion - Control Resource Set**

Set of time frequency resources on resource grid on which PDCCH is transmitted. This is QPSK modulated too.

This occupies 6 contiguous RBs and occupies 1-3 OFDM symbols of time.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/848f7001-583e-438b-8879-671180dbe720)

**SIB 1**

After decoding MIB, the SIB 1 which was contained within needs to be decoded.
Now the SIB 1 is transmitted on PDSCH, now this info about SIB 1 location is transmitted through DCI which is transmitted on PDCCH, at CORESET 0 region of PDCCH.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20cb5653-f26e-4562-a5ee-ace50cf7e1b0)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7cfce85-a0fc-459f-b378-9877b22f8416)

So the remaining system info is all decoded by UE only after first decoding SIB 1.

**2. Initial Access(RACH procedure)**

After a cell has been found, RACH procedure needs to be done.

Here CCCH (common control channels) are used.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e26fa6e5-e0c1-490c-8fe7-d80d58c2946e)

The control channels(in purple) are playing auxiliary role to physical channels(in orange)

The RACH(random access channel) is used to send a preamble to the cell.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f41e184-20a3-4c03-91e2-cd530c8213bd)

Using PDCCH cell assigns UE a PDSCH.
And a response is sent through PDSCH also.

Now through uplink PUSCH a RRC setup request is sent.
Again cell assigns PDSCH with PDCCH and sends RRC setup messages.

and UE acknowledges using PUSCH.

**3. Scheduled Data Transmission Procedure**

Now since we are in RRC connected mode, we use dedicated traffic channels.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70b1e333-6c62-4d99-9ece-1f630b7928e6)

Now for example, cell needs to transmit some data to UE. The following procedure is used.  

UCI-uplink control information

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6979fbca-78b0-433d-9215-20dca7c91b73)

In response to the data or signalling recieved through PDSCH a UCI(some info or signalling to be sent to cell) is sent by UE to cell.

Now again PDCCH is used to assign PUSCH to cell so that it can sent the UCI. Then cell can acknowledge using PDCCH

In below picture we can see the uplink and downlink channels and how UCI and DCI is sent and then acknowledged.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58fb24c5-e4f1-4049-abed-fdd8243e343b)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2762a8b-8f86-444e-a2ca-225ab00174a4)


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a30b038c-06bf-432c-94bf-55cce09c8022)

UE also sends feedback on the subcarriers on downlink channel through UCI.
This is the CQI-channel quality information.

**CORESET Revisited**

We know that PDCCH is located at the region called CORESET. This also means that CORESET is located at downlink.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a094e2fa-c9e7-4cb0-ac26-3cfec112abc8)

CORESET 0 has the MSI of cell so it cannot be turned off.

**4. Paging Process**

Paging Control Channel is used by cell to page UE (for eg. incoming call-the connected mode thing not voice call, for UE).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70ed3dda-a086-4920-85f0-e3f62208ad95)

UE responds to this paging by starting the RACH procedure.
