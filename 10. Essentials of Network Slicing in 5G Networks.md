**What is a Network Slice?**

It is a virtually isolated part of the network serving a definied customer, consisting of all required NFs. Network Slice resources can be increased or decreased as per demand.
User experiences all network slices as different networks.

All different services in 5G have separate slices.
So, Vo5G, URLLC, eMBB, mMTC will all have different slices.
Of course, there can also be multiple of the same type of network slice in a network according to user requirements.

**Network Slicing Example in 5G**

![networkslicing](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/968a0243-b5c0-4361-8064-961b1382a0d1)

Here the first UE is using two services, Vo5G and eMBB and we can see the AMF and NRF it is connected to is further connected to two 5G cores. DN stands for data network.

The user experiences this as separate networks but can still use  both services at same time.

The second UE is using only one service and thus AMF is part of the single core which connects to the data network.

The NSSF and UDM are common for both of these UEs since they are connected to the same RAN.

**Single Network Slice Selection Assistance Information(S-NSSAI)**

Note how the entire NSSAI is of 4 bytes...That may have some significance.

![s-nssai](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d48a1b3-e525-4fdb-95fb-65a8e52e4fc0)

The nssai identifies a network slice.
It contains Slice type info and slice differentiator info(optional)

The Slice type info contains some code which identifies which service that network slice is providing, for example 1 is for eMBB, 2 for URLLC etc.

For example, there are 2 eMBB slices for different users in a network, we can differentiate b/w them using SD part of NSSAI.

**Network Slice Subnet Instance(NSSI)**

Network Slice instance(NSI) is composed of NSSIs.

![nsi=nssi*n](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc2d8417-d650-42ea-beb0-b25c428bed1b)

So we can see an example of the paths of NSIs or network slices in a network.

![nsi=nssi*n2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddeef123-ee93-4d54-9ecb-1f8433e867f9)

There also must be support for multiple slices (max 8) for a UE.
A PDU session is associated with only one NSSAI.
So multiple PDU sessions must be established for multiple slices(multiple services at once).
Only one AMF is used though for all slices and sessions, SMF UPF can be separate.

![multislicesupport](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd844683-7563-47df-ba10-d298c28b914b)

**NSI Life cycle**

![nsilifecycle](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1774156e-5efd-4897-afa9-9a4e5c24a321)

These tasks are managed by NSMF.

- Preparation Phase: A network slice blueprint or template lists nescessary attributes of Network Slice.
  If a previous blueprint matches the network requirements of user, it can either be used as it is or it can be scaled up or down according to requirements.
  
  ![prepphase/nsi](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a4fb034-0386-4fff-afc7-265d4aca68d3)

  In this case preparation phase can be skipped since we dont need to make a new template.
  In case new template needs to be made.
  Then after template is made,it is onboarded(or put into catalogue) then the network environment is prepped for new slice.

- Instantiation & Configuration Phase
  All resources (shared/dedicated) needed by NSI are created(or instantiated) and configured.
  Actions needed to make NSI active, eg. diverting traffic to it, provisioning databases.
  
  ![instant,config,activate/nsi](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffe4e45a-e83f-4829-8772-8e112273f61d)

- Run-time Phase
  Performance of NSI is monitered using Key Performance Indicators(KPI)-reporting
  for eg. in Vo5G NSI, call is dropping. this info is sent using KPI

  Supervision-NSI may need to be modified(capacity,topology-nf connections,adding/deleting NFs)

  ![runtime/nsi](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa21689f-290e-468a-942a-e11aca01bef2)

- Decommissioning Phase
  NSI has reached end of life, it is killed or deactivated.
  Dedicated resources are freed for other use and Shared resources are reconfigured for other uses.

**Network Slice Management Model**

User sends its requirements to CSP. CSP uses CSMF to translates these requirements into network requirements(network type,capacity,QoS reqs for slice).
NSP now uses NSMF(which also manages network slice functions) to translate network requirements into network slice subnet requirements and gives it to the NSSP which uses NSSMF to manage the subnet at the lowest level.

**RAN Slicing Example**

![ranslicing](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6959726f-64e7-4f3d-80f2-c137cff38247)

Here the management model is used for RAN slicing.

Now taking the subnet reqs the RAN central unit(see first chs) is divided(virtually) into three network services.

Now the distributed unit is also sliced as below wherein the physical resources are distributed

![duslicing](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56dcbdab-9138-476f-b775-742662d003a9)

AI/ML(RAN intelligent control) monitors these slices and takes action to optimize this process.

The NSSMF also manages the core network slicing.

**Slice Availability in 5G Network**

![sliceavailability](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35481751-b856-4a50-b3ed-d9f91d7008d9)

Registration area is a list of tracking areas(group of cells) which support a common set of slices.

**Signaling Related to Slice Availability**

The slice availabity info is shared between NSSF and AMF on N22 interface and between AMF and RAN on N2 interface and between RANs on Xn interface.

Network Slice Selection Function (NSSF) selects the network slicing instance (NSI), determines the allowed network slice selection assistance information (NSSAI) and set AMF to serve the UE.

Omc-operations and maintenance centre

![omc](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9449084e-35ce-4b03-93e2-1b46d10a91b5)

the GNBs are configured according to their TAs.

through N2:
- the GNBs inform the AMFs about the S-NSSAI supported in TA.
- the AMFs inform the GNBs about what S-NSSAI they support as per PLMN-ID(operator in given area id)

through Xn:
- one GNBs communicates with other about which S-NSSAi it is associated with in its TA.

![amf-nssf](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b4f46f6-dfc3-4f14-a9aa-06708db6edfc)

**NSSF**

For example, A UE wants to access the network and sends the information about which network slice it wants to the AMF but that network slice is not accessible due to either AMF not supporting that network or some other reason.
The AMF forwards this request to the NSSF which updates the AMF about which other network slice should be served to the user and then AMF sends this back to UE through the established PDU session.
The information recieved by UE is about another network slice which has the desired service,a new AMF which supports the desired Network Slice and also the NRF for that particular NSI.
