**5G Roaming Architecture**

For the authentication procedure we know that we need AMF, AUSF and UDM.
For roaming if a device wants to authenticate while in VPLMN, AMF of Visiting PLMN is used but AUSF & UDM always need to be of the Home PLMN.

Also the UPF flow goes through VUPF to Hupf then to data network on the user plane.
Both UPFs are controlled by their respective SMFs.
