**5G Roaming Architecture**

For the authentication procedure we know that we need AMF, AUSF and UDM.
For roaming if a device wants to authenticate while in VPLMN, AMF of Visiting PLMN is used but AUSF & UDM always need to be of the Home PLMN.

![roaming](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/176c3242-c378-4c59-8cd2-a73c585cf5f8)

Also the UPF flow goes through VUPF to Hupf then to data network on the user plane.
Both UPFs are controlled by their respective SMFs.

**Logical Entities for Network Access Security**

![logicalentities](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2906a18a-3a76-4c33-b2d8-1cfd73ddf502)


- ARPF:
  One of the most imp logical entities.
  Contains subscriber security info such as long term/master key(denoted as K), this is used in authentication. Master Key also helps derive ciphering and integrity protection keys.

  Also contains SUPI

  ARPF services provided via UDM it does not have a open interface for UDM.

  ![udm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d503146-8a67-40ce-910e-91e4fea757b3)

- SIDF:
  Contained within UDM in home network as a service.
  Responsible for removing concealment from SUCI to retrieve SUPI
  SUPI is encrypted as SUCI before going through air interface, goes to AMF, then to AUSF, then to UDM and to SIDF.

  ![sucipathtosidf](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9c01c7e-7f0e-444b-aa4b-3f8b3edd8f14)

- AUSF:
  Standalone NF, always located in home network of a UE. Responsible for handling authentication based on info from UDM/ARPF.

- SEAF:
  Functionality inside AMF, responsible for handling authentication in AMF.

  ![seaf](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5eeeff01-c432-4ecb-9926-73916c1e65c4)

**Network Access Security**

Comprises of all security functions in a network.

Most important part of this is mutual authentication(happens during first-time authentication,moving from one TA to other, going from IDLE to connected mode) that is, when both home network and UE need to verify with each other.

Let us assume UE is not in home network and is roaming, it needs to mutually authenticate with the home network first.

UE and the home network must support two mutual authentication methods:

5G AKA(authentication and key agreement) for 3GPP access.
EAP-AKA(extensible authentication protocol) for non 3GPP access.

![netaccsecurity](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5d05813-81c9-451c-96f6-f3ac2c2dd7d8)

![integrity&ciphering](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/104ef248-2137-45de-9c84-ef621cde1961)


Once authentication is complete ciphering and integrity keys are generated(as in diagram green arrows).
There are two cases where ciphering and integrity protection signalling is done:

1.Between UE and visiting network:
Ciphering is done whenever regulation permits, and integrity protection is done mandatorily with exceptions.

2.Between UE and GNB(RRC Signalling):
Ciphering is done mandatorily and integrity protection is doen whenever regulation permits.

Now after data is sent to GNB, in the user plane, that is from GNB to UPF and from UPF to data network, the data falls under domain of network domain security and is different.

**Initiation of Authentication Procedure**

1. Power-On:
   This process is done through N1 interface and is called N1 message.
   If device was previously registered it already has GUTI in AMF.
   If device is registering then SUCI is sent through air interface.
   SEAF in AMF has the sole purpose to forward this to AUSF.
   
   ![power-on](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d809d7d-afc8-476f-82a2-9cc2cda22703)

2. Forward to AUSF:
   The message format can be seen in picture below, it is according to naming scheme.
   If GUTI was recieved, then AMF forwards SUPI(which it knows) to the AUSF.
   If SUCI was recived it forwards that to AUSF.
   This is all done through NAUSF interface in SBA.

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35942b98-0142-416d-b808-3fdb4fe72e55)

   Another parameter sent is the SN-name

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d3f0869-6bc9-4618-92d7-d912140a7a73)

3. AUSF to UDM
   Now through NUDM interface.
   If SUCI recieved, then SUPI is formed with SIDF.
   Otherwise, based on SUPI, UDM decides which authentication method is to be used(For 5G devices-AKA and for non 5G-EAP-AKA).

**Concealment/Deconcealment of SUPI**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a3798c4-36c0-4559-8b08-c26287ceed00)

SUPI has SUPI type which states if device is 5G or not. because in 3GPP SUPI you have TMSI but in others you have other identifiers.
The encrypted part of SUPI is the MSIN, it is encrypted using the Home Network Public Key, ID of public key used for ciphering is also sent in SUCI.
What type of encryption(Scheme ID) is also sent in SUCI.

Now when it reaches the UDM/SIDF, only UDM/SIDF of home network(this is why UDM and AUSF always need to be of the home network has the private key which can decrypt the public key. Private key along with scheme ID is used to decrypt.

Now after decryption we have the home network number as well as SUPI.

## 5G AKA Heirarchy

From the master key(K) in the ARPF in UDM we derive the CK/IK(ciphering key & integrity protect key)
then from that we derive the Kausf which is formed in ARPF then passed to the AUSF.
From Kausf we derive the Kseaf which is then passed to the SEAF by the AUSF.
SEAF derives the Kamf from Kseaf and passes it to AMF.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/805be6a0-c1c4-4b5c-9852-d61f1caeda87)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/214deac3-065f-491b-9d0c-4181ecb359d5)


In the AMF, we derive the Knasint(integrity key) and Knasenc(encryption key), this is used for integrity protection and ciphering on the NAS communication link b/w AMF & UE.

Kgnb is also generated from Kamf and is sent to GNB by AMF and is stored there till the UE is in connected mode.
Krrcint and Krrcenc is derived from Kgnb for integrity & ciphering of signalling b/w UE and GNB, Kupint and Kupenc also generated form Kgnb and is used for the same but for user plane signalling.

Now all of these above keys are for network side and for mutual authentication we also need these keys on UE side.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47332417-c4c5-4832-9cd9-45ab3072f14a)

On UE side master key is in USIM then from that CK/IK is derived then sent to Mobile Equipment where other keys are derived.

They are lower level because in OSI they are in data link layer(2nd layer).

**EAP-AKA for Non-3GPP Access Architecture**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efd91f6b-52ae-42fe-9b30-2dbb23423e14)

Here N3IWF is used for untrusted non 3gpp access, instead of RAN device connects to WLAN access network.
The N3IWF does protocol conversion and rate adaptation to make it possible for non 5G device to access 5G core network.

IETF is a telecom organization that makes standsards for telecom as RFCs which are implemented.

In the case of 5G AKA, authentication vector is generated in the ARPF but here a transformed AV is formed which has certain parameters.

**EAP AKA' Security Key Heirarchy**

It can be understood similarly to the above heirarchy
