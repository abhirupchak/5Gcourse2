## Tracking Areas



When a UE is in IDLE mode(only registered not connected yet), only Tracking Areas information is know about the mobile.

When UE connects to the network the allocated TMSI is shared with all cells in the tracking area.

**THE PURPOSE OF BUILDING A TRACKING AREA IS TO REDUCE THE SIGNALING LOAD ON NETWORK**

When UE moves from one tracking area to another in IDLE mode all the network needs to do is update its tracking area to know its general location.

The UE's which move with very high speed have a list of nearby tracking areas transmitted to them by the core network.
The UE only moves in those TAs without ever updating its TA.
