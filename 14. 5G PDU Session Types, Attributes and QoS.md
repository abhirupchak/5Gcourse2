**PDU Session and its Attributes**

A PDU session is independant of the fact whether UE has registered with network or not.
**UE can be registered without PDU session.**

If IPv4 type PDU session is established, SMF assigns a IPv4 IP to the UE.
In IPv4v6 type, SMF assigns two IPs to UE.

There is a problem with using IP PDU sessions.
This is because IP packets have their source and destination in their headers.Thus, header size is large.

Due to large header size, packet transport may have some issues. This is a big problem for 5G services like mMTC and URLLC which require absolute precision in packet delivery.

A workaround to this is developed, which is the ethernet PDU session type.
In this type we use MAC addresses as the source and destination.
In this case, SMF does not provide any address.
Instead, UE provides its MAC address to the SMF which uses it to create PDU session.

Unstructured layer is used when there is no knowledge of type of data being sent.

Name of data network to which PDU session is connected and also the name of network slice.

**QoS Rule for QoS Flow**

Inside a PDU session there may be one or more QoS flows, there are certain rules attached to these flows that it has to follow.

**PDU Session States**

If UE is in CM-connected state and has PDU session, PDU session is in active state.
If UE is in CM-idle state and has PDU session, PDU session is in idle state.

N9 tunnel is only present as sub-bearer if there are 2 UPFs connected to UE.

The parameters required for the establishment of sub bearers are,
the radio bearer-ID, the tunnel(N3,N9) endpoint IDs and the IP address of UE.

DRB and N3 tunnel are released.
If PDU session goes inactive, the parameters for sub bearers are still retained in UE, GNB and AMF.
They can be used to quickly activate PDU session again if required.

**Types of QoS flows**

**Allocation and Retention Priority(ARP)**

**QoS Identifier**

Every type of QoS flow has its identifier. This has 6 parameters.

Now, the priority of this QoS parameter is different from ARP priority, this priority is dealt with by UPF depending on which QoS flow needs to go first.
In ARP we see what type of data in QoS flow needs to go first.

**What are Packet Filters?**

Identifies the incoming traffic in a PDU session and distributes it to the correct QoS flow depending on certain parameters.

**5G Reflective QoS**

Purspose is to reduce signalling load.
Basically, the UE mirrors or copies the DL QoS rules that were sent to it in the DL QoS flow. It mirrors those rules and uses those to send UL data through QoS flow. 
Thus no extra signalling is used.
