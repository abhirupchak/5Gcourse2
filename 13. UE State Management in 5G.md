RRC state- state of connection b/w GNB and UE. GNB keeps track of this on network side.
Connection Management State- NAS connection b/w UE and AMF. AMF keeps track on network side.
Registration Management State- If UE is registered with 5G network or not. AMF keeps track on network side.

**RRC State**

In RRC idle, according to broadcast info from GNB and from its power level, it finds GNB with highest power level in the area or switches if its GNB is weak.
This is called cell selection/reselection.

If UE wants to register with 5G network or wants to make voice call, it must be in RRC connected mode.
Now in connected state, network knows cell of UE as well before it only knew TA.

**UE Mobility in RRC Inactive State & RAN areas**

All different colour cells in picture belong to different RAN areas. None of them overlaps and each is identified using RAN Area ID.

Since RNAs are bigger than cells, this reduces the energy consumption of more regular updates to the network.
This is because the UE only notifies the network if it moves into a cell from another RNA.
Thus inactive mode is very energy efficient and especially useful for mMTC.

**Connection Management State(CM State)**

To see if there is active NAS connection b/w UE & AMF or not(also called N1 signalling link since N1 interface is used).
If UE is already registered with network then registration area(list of TAs assigned to UE) is already known to network or more specifically, the AMF knows.



In CM-IDLE mode there is no connection.


**Now, if UE is not registered or if UE wants to make a data transfer, or if it has moved out of previous Reg. Area, for all
these things UE needs to be in CM-Connected State.**

CM-Connected State can be achieved using RRC Connection.

**Registraion Management(RM) State**

In RM-deregistered state UE is either switched off or not registered with 5G network.

Once UE is registered to network, or more specifically to AMF, it is now served by that AMF and is assigned a GUTI.

Also it needs to update network if it moves from one reg. area to other through registration update procedure.
