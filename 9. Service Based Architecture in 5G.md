**5G SBA**

![sba](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4d380a5-bab9-4be0-9c7a-87079d38db53)

Up till now we have been talking about a 5G system that has only specific connection between Network Functions for a very specific purpose.
This is called reference point architecture.

![refpnt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0dd7636f-029d-4b11-bd8a-e9f00f9e0328)

For service based architecture we have a common interface between network functions for communications for all purposes.
All these network functions can be run as software on the cloud.

**NF Service Mechanism**

NFs can request and recieve requests for network service to and from each other in the following methods.

**HTTP/2 for 5G Core Network Communication**

There are some notable advantages to using this method.
Easy deployment in cloud environment.
HTTP/2 is already very widely used throughout the internet, it has good security and third party applications for the core network.
It allows for easy integration of operator apps and third party apps in the 5G core network.

**HTTP2 on Web & in 5G core network**

JSON format specific.

**Resource in 5G core network**

A PDU session, its context and QoS policy are all resources.
A Network Function registering with NRF is also a resource.
Resource located and manipulated as URI(uniform resource identifier) in HTTP.

For example a SMF is registering itself in the NRF, so SMF will send a resource request through HTTP2 to NRF to locate that particular URI of that registration and NRF will return that to SMF through HTTP2.

## HTTP Methods In 5G architecture

When a service consumer(SMF in previous example) requests some service from service provider(NRF), it uses one of the following HTTP methods.

**HTTP Responses**

These are 3 digit codes sent by the service provider.

**Naming Scheme for NF Service**

**REST in 5G Services**

Rest(representational state transer) is a style of architecture for softwares. In 5G conext rest is used for HTTP protocols in service requests or responses.
