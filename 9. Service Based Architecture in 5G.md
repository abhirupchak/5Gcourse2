**5G SBA**

![sba](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4d380a5-bab9-4be0-9c7a-87079d38db53)

Up till now we have been talking about a 5G system that has only specific connection between Network Functions for a very specific purpose.
This is called reference point architecture.

![refpnt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0dd7636f-029d-4b11-bd8a-e9f00f9e0328)

For service based architecture we have a common interface between network functions for communications for all purposes.
All these network functions can be run as software on the cloud.
Whenever a certain service is required by a NF it can request that from the service provider NF through REST.

**NF Service Mechanism**

NFs can request and recieve requests for network service to and from each other in the following methods. It is done through HTTP methods.

![servicemechs](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/699542da-5963-4f42-9949-9c71c0a89cdd)

**HTTP/2 for 5G Core Network Communication**

There are some notable advantages to using this method.
Easy deployment in cloud environment.
HTTP/2 is already very widely used throughout the internet, it has good security and third party applications for the core network.
It allows for easy integration of operator apps and third party apps in the 5G core network.

**HTTP2 on Web & in 5G core network**

![http2onwebncore](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf7550c8-5130-497d-8efa-044466dcb2f2)

JSON format specific.

![jsonexample](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57a47462-11ab-4a47-901d-f961ae953093)

**Resource in 5G core network**

A PDU session, its context and QoS policy are all resources.
A Network Function registering with NRF is also a resource.
Resource located and manipulated as URI(uniform resource identifier) in HTTP.

For example a SMF is registering itself in the NRF, so SMF will send a resource request through HTTP2 to NRF to locate that particular URI of that registration and NRF will return that to SMF through HTTP2.

## HTTP Methods In 5G architecture

When a service consumer(SMF in previous example) requests some service from service provider(NRF), it uses one of the following HTTP methods.

![httpmethods](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcb6234f-2c78-4d77-9b51-8ab162d3a22d)

**HTTP Responses**

These are 3 digit codes sent by the service provider.

**Naming Scheme for NF Service**

**REST in 5G Services**

Rest(representational state transer) is a style of architecture for softwares. In 5G context rest is used for HTTP protocols in service requests or responses.

![restin5gcore](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0600c528-c792-4d11-a4fe-62810d003e8f)

RESTFUL DESIGN

Stateless Design - Means that no information about the previous or future "states" (or request information) is kept on server side(service provider). Only current state information is kept by client side.  

![restful_design](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44963426-cb00-4772-9859-d41c3191c3ce)

All these principles which are usually used in web applications are also applied to 5G core network communication.

**Example of HTTP2 REST USE CASE**

In the below picture, we can see the service request from a NF to the NRF for registering itself.

In the NF service name we can see it is requesting the NFManagement service provided by the NRF and the service operation is NFRegister Request.
It is done using the HTTP PUT method to create the URI mentioned below, here the resource to be created is the Registration of this NF.

![NFregister_usingHTTPPUT](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e4dc12f-8cac-4011-95c4-fd0cbe86307e)

The URI format for the registration of NF is as below.Api root and api name part syntax is explained.

![URIformat](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4caaf199-5e9c-4545-b50e-cd7a4f91e342)

Along with the above request sent using HTTP PUT a JSON message is also sent, it is in the below format.

![jsonmsgbody](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d8fcebb-bc81-451e-8bb4-787cb5b42f38)

For service response, we also have a similarly formatted service response.
A HTTP 201 message is sent meaning registration URI was created.
NFRegisterResponse is the service operation being used this time.

![http201message](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/550eeb0e-efde-4eb7-a408-a650ce899b16)

Along with the 201 message, a json message is also sent which contains heartbeat timer(max gap b/w heartbeart reqs-heartbeat reqs are reqs sent to service provides signifying that the NF is still alive and in use).

![heartbeat_reqs](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73425562-bb43-4a58-a905-daebb2d9a07b)

For heartbeat reqs, HTTP PATCH method is used to the URI to update the NRF that registering NF is still alive and NRF sends a HTTP 200 OK response.
Here we are still using NFManagement service of NRF.

**How are Services Provided by NFs Found by Other NFs?**

Here is another use case of HTTP REST.

![httpgettoNRF](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b25199de-8211-4e42-ac43-539ac1cf4db5)

Here a NF requests the NRF in the serving PLMN using the HTTP GET method to the URI(the URI here is the discovery itself).
The URI format is similar to earlier one except the ?queryparameters part, which includes the definitions in the query to be sent such as desired servicename,target-nftype,target-plmn and the network slices supported by desired services.

![queryparameters](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebb59d47-5684-4967-b05c-98f95124f0f4)

Next the serving PLMN sends the same discoverrequest forward to the target PLMN which has the desired service provider, it then responds with HTTP 200 OK along with JSON body only difference is that it uses discover response service operation.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc128026-548e-47dc-af1d-aa5ae5784f69)

NF instance carries information about what NFs are in target PLMN and the array contains information about those NFs in nfprofile.
After serving PLMN recieves response from target PLMN it sends it forward to requester NF which now has all nescessary information about NFs in target PLMN which support the service that the Requester NF wants to use.
