## NFV

**Problems with Traditional Mobile Networks**

Older networks have a hardware problem, it is expensive to buy, install, maintain and upgrade.
And since in older networks if any small component went faulty, the same part had to be bought from the same vendor so there was a monopoly on products.
New vendors could not enter market.
If new use cases(such as IoT) needed to be accomodated, it was difficult to manually upgrade the hardware.

**NFV**

Network functionalities are run on software which runs on COTS(commercial off the shelf) 

**COTS are easily available in the market(servers,storage,switches) but the software(NFV) is specialized**
This is much more cost effective, new vendors can easily buy COTS and run their own software on it, and to upgrade all you need to do is upgrade software.

**NFV Structure**

VNFs-SMF,AMF,UPF,PCF etc.

All VNFs run on the NFV infrastructure(cots hardware).

**Advantages of NFV**
- **5G network functions can be run on either cots or cloud it dependson needs of service provider(such as security(there is private cloud for that) and if they want to pay cloud fees or build their own hardware once and for all)**

## Network Slicing

Dividing the same network into different slices depending on their QoS requirements. It basically builds **End to End Virtual Networks** tailored to service requirements.

eg. looking at the picture below we see in the first virtual network slice for mobile broadband, a ISP is providing broadband services.

**THESE SLICES ARE SEPARATED IN BOTH CONTROL AND USER PLANE**

**Network Slicing functions**

NFV allows all these different slices to run on same physical infrastructure and they wont interfere with each other since they are isolated virtually.
