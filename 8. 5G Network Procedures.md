**UE Registration**

How does a UE register itself with the network?

By the **acquistion procedure**, UE discovers nearby cells by reading their PSS(primary synchronization sequence) and SSS(secondary ss).

If it is a primary cell, then broadcast information is sent to UE, this contains information about channel structure of a cell(what channels and which frequecies the cell is using). 
This also has information about which network operator the cell is from.
This information broadcast through PBCH(physical broadcast channel)

Now after cell acquistion, **network selection** is done.

If possible the UE connects with previous PLMN(network identifier).
if that is not possible it connects with the device home network(home PLMN-ID)
then after that it goes to user list and then operator list.
If none of these is possible it connects with network with most powerful signal.

Then after network selection, UE connects with the most powerful signal cell in that network.

## Power On Procedure

First security is established by a process named 5G AKA(Authentication and Key Agreement).

AKA relies on the shared secret key, UE knows network is authentic and network knows UE is authentic.

![akaprocedure](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d627d1eb-bc9b-4455-9009-a2f3767bbb77)

After the AKA procedure,

All signalling between the network and the device is encrypted,
The UE to GNodeB signalling(Access Stratum signalling) and UE to AMF(non access stratum signalling) are both encrypted

- **UE Context Installation**
This process records the UE context in the AMF.
AMF request for this contex from UDM.

This allows AMF to know the following about device.

- **Policy Check**

![policycheck](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0e2a058-dc52-4b08-aeca-25f8e48acac1)

Checks if user can actually access network in current conditions.

-**5G-TMSI-S Allocation**

If the policy check is successful, a TMSI is allocated to the mobile network.
Now all signaling between network and UE is using this TMSI.
This TMSI can potentially change if UE moves out of range of that particular AMF's range.

**NOW THE UE IS IN EITHER IDLE MODE OR CONNECTED MODE**

## UE IDLE and Connected Mode

**IDLE MODE**

![IDLEmode](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6c6a9b6-0168-4c21-9c65-958c2a18510c)

**Connected Mode**

![connectedmode](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ce754dd-44d9-419f-b5c3-11ecee92eef8)


## PDU Session Establishment

Once UE has registered and wants to avail any network service, it can request AMF for PDU session establishment.

**UE Paging Procedure**

![pagingprocedure](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd19d468-9453-437b-a435-e8ac4620d2e1)

After Step 4, The UE with the correct TMSI will respond to the AMF paging and then connect to the core network again to establish PDU session for incoming downlink data.

**Tracking Area Update Procedure**

![trackingareaupdate](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f13f5787-8d5f-4791-a05e-3d13c2a936b2)

**Handover Procedure**

Handovers only happen when device is in connected mode(since network only knows tracking area in idle mode).

The network decides if the UE needs to be switched over to another cell(gnodeb).
The UE moves from source GNB to target GNB.

There are two types of handover.

**Xn Handover**

The target GNB asks source GNB for handover co-ordination.

![Xnhandover](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74d61050-e59f-4c0a-a703-9f2f9388c0a3)

The PDU session can then be switched from source GNB to target GNB.

**N2 Handover**

In this handover, there is no communication between the two GNBs, AMF acts as middleman.
Once UE is switched, AMF asks SMF to switch PDU session.SMF requests UPF to switch PDU session.
