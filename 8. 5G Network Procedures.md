**UE Registration**

How does a UE register itself with the network?

By the **acquistion procedure**, UE discovers nearby cells by reading their PSS(primary synchronization sequence) and SSS(secondary ss).

If it is a primary cell, then broadcast information is sent to UE, this contains information about channel structure of a cell(what channels and which frequecies the cell is using). 
This also has information about which network operator the cell is from.
This information broadcast through PBCH(physical broadcast channel)

Now after cell acquistion, **network selection** is done.

If possible the UE connects with previous PLMN(network identifier).
if that is not possible it connects with the device home network(home PLMN-ID)
then after that it goes to user list and then operator list.
If none of these is possible it connects with network with most powerful signal.

Then after network selection, UE connects with the most powerful signal cell in that network.

## Power On Procedure

First security is established by a process named 5G AKA(Authentication and Key Agreement).

AKA relies on the shared secret key, UE knows network is authentic and network knows UE is authentic.

After the AKA procedure,

All signalling between the network and the device is encrypted,
The UE to GNodeB signalling(Access Stratum signalling) and UE to AMF(non access stratum signalling) are both encrypted

- **UE Context Installation**
This process records the UE context in the AMF.
AMF request for this contex from UDM.

This allows AMF to know the following about device.
