**Intro to Vo5G**

EPS fallback: when 5g coverage not available switches to EPS system(4g core) for Voice call service.


**Codecs for Vo5G**

Codecs: Digitizes and compresses at transmitter and decompresses and converts to analog at reciever.

There are 2 codecs:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3a948b8-5ae1-4909-8589-29d3ad69c5cb)

in both codecs, RTP(radio transport protocol) packets are used then at transport layer UDP is used and finally IP packets are used.

**Session Intitiation Protocol for Control Signalling**

Info sent with SIP packets such as,

**IMS in 5G System**

Some new services are introduced in 5G that can communicate with IMS system.These have the prefic Ncx_IMS.

CSCFs in IMS:
  These are functions that control the SIP packets in 5G system. There are 3 types of CSCFs:

  1. Proxy CSCF: First point of contact with IMS network as far as UE is concerned, UE always first contacts PCSCF(for registration) which passes it to other functions.

  2. Interrogating CSCF: Checks if UE if is already registered with IMS network. Can assign SCSCFs to UEs or route them to their SCSCF.

  3. Serving CSCF: Authenticates UE registration

TAS in IMS

SCSCF works with TAS to provide these supplementary services to Voice calls.

**IMS Connectivity Requirement & PDU Session for IMS**

For using IMS, UE needs to connect to IMS.
A PDU session is established which connects to Public Data network, PDN is connected to IMS so from there connection is established.
More precisely UE connects with PCSCF in IMS network.

For registration, one QoS flow is required, the default QoS flow, in PDU session for IMS signalling, decided by operator is used for this.
For voice call, two QoS flows are used, the default QoS flow, which serves the purpose of establishing, maintaining and running the voice call and on the second QoS flow(IMS media bearer), actual voice packets are sent.
The type of packets sent are decided by what type of Voice call it is.

**UE Registration with IMS System**

1.PCSCF Discovery
  In order to communicate with IMS system, it needs to know IP address of at least one PCSCF.
  The procedure for this is called PCSCF discovery.

 Done in 3 ways:

 1. When PDU session is established, SMF notifies UE about its IP address as well as IP of PCSCF.
 2. Can already be configured into UE.
 3. DHCP server can notify UE of PCSCF IP or domain name which can be translated by DNS query done by UE.

2.Signalling Flow
  These are all done through SIP packet messaging.
  In the double sided arrow in the middle, ICSCF and UDM are connected. This shows that ICSCF checks UDM to find if UE is already registered with IMS. If yes, it redirects to that SCSCF. If no, it provides UE a SCSCF.
  
  We can also see that mutual authentication is done between SCSCF and UE.

**3rd Party Registration in IMS**

**SIP Signalling for Vo5G Setup**

Both UEs in a voice call must be registered with IMS. That means both must have been assigned a SCSCF by ICSCF.
Again SIP packets messaging are used for this.

PRACK- progress acknowledgement.

**IMS Media Bearer Establishment for Vo5G**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/851245da-7f3f-41f6-bf6f-a40e9392eae7)

We know that PCSCF is point of contact and thus keeps track of all SIP messaging b/w UE and IMS system.
So it has info about SDPs b/w calling and called party.
SDP- session description protocol

It then does the following procedure:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aad89097-a369-4416-abb2-fb94c6ff1240)

This informs PCF about the parameters under which voice call should be setup.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/966b0b10-46b6-4a9f-ad09-fa9a871151e4)

SMF would then communicate with AMF & UPF to setup IMS Media Bearer.

**Tear Down of 5G Voice Call**

At SIP level it is quite simple,

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8dddeb3f-bb21-460b-8c46-1c873408ac84)

QoS flows are a little different:

1. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e981096c-4db2-4c16-9f9c-dce1bfcb5688)

2. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0c09209-a9c7-4e4b-890c-e82ff96f1d2d)

3. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/436feb21-6873-4300-a8c2-88b0c40a7df3)

Then the QoS flows are also terminated.

**EPS Fallback for Vo5G**

Useful when NSA system are in majority.
